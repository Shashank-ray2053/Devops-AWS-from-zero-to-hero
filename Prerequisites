01) What is devops?
--> DevOps is a combination of "Development (Dev)" and "Operations (Ops)".  
It is a cultural and technical practice that improves:
- Collaboration
- Automation
- Continuous delivery
- Software quality
- Infrastructure reliability

## Why DevOps Exists?
--> Before DevOps, developers and operations teams worked separately:

- Developers: Write code  
- Operations: Deploy & maintain servers  

This caused delays, miscommunication, and bugs.

DevOps solves these problems using:
- Automation  
- CI/CD  
- Infrastructure as Code  
- Monitoring  
- Containerization  
- Cloud computing  

## DevOps Lifecycle
1. Planning – Define requirements, features, and improvements using tools like Jira or Trello.

2. Coding/Development – Write and manage code collaboratively, often using Git.

3. Building – Compile code into deployable artifacts using CI tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI.

4. Testing – Automated and manual tests to ensure quality and reliability.

5. Release – Deploy the code to staging or production environments.

6. Deploy – Continuous deployment into production with minimal downtime.

7. Operate – Monitor performance, logs, and infrastructure.

8. Monitor – Collect metrics and feedback for improvements.
